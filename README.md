WPM (Words Per Minute) is a tool to help you improve your typing accuracy and speed. Begin typing and the 60 second counter will start. It measures your typing speed and accuracy, displays words you mistyped, and gives you a score so that you can see how well you did.

There is also a cheating detection implementation so it prevents users from cheating!

WPM was built during a solo 2-day hackathon hosted by Hack Reactor, a full stack web development immersive in San Francisco, CA.
